The program is written in the course of the Yaroslavl State Technical University basics of information security.
Developed in the Visual Studio 2010.

To run the program requires MS Windows with .net framework 4.0

To use:
Create input.txt in the directory with the application.
Enter "encode_<Count Shift>" in the first row and any proposal to the English (or other language, see will down) in the second.
Run the application, resulting in the file output.txt will be shifted to line symbols in accordance with the Caesar cipher.
Copy the line in output.txt and paste it instead of the previous one in input.txt.
Replace "encode_ .." to "decode". Run the application again.
As a result, output.txt will be the source string (lowercase words and spaces)
Example:

write in input.txt:
"
encode_42
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as a Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

To work in a different language, use encode_<shift value> <two-letter abbreviation of language> and decode <two-letter abbreviation of language>, respectively.
Example: "encode_3 ru" 
You can also set the default language in appname.exe.config file. For this to work in the file you want to create a section langconfig.xml <LanguageModel> and fill it. 
Example of section:

  <LanguageModel>
    <Shortname>EN</Shortname>
    <Alphabet>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</Alphabet>
    <AffFilename>en_US.aff</AffFilename>
    <DicFilename>en_US.dic</DicFilename>
  </LanguageModel>
Files en_US.aff, en_US.dic - standard dictionaries Hunspell
